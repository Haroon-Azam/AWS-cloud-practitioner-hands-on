# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Objective
To understand and implement **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** by creating users, groups, and policies, and applying the principle of least privilege.

---

## AWS Services Used
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

---

## Tasks Performed
- Created an IAM user for secure console access
- Created an IAM group
- Attached AWS-managed policies to the group
- Added the IAM user to the group
- Logged in using the IAM user instead of the root account

---

## Why IAM is Important
IAM helps control:
- **Who** can access AWS
- **What** resources they can access
- **What actions** they can perform

Using IAM improves security and follows AWS best practices by avoiding root account usage.

---

## Outcome
- Successfully configured IAM users and groups
- Applied permissions using policies
- Verified access by logging in as the IAM user

---

## Notes
- Root account is used only for account setup
- No access keys or sensitive credentials are shared
